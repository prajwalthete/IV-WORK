## Onepoket Node Developer Coding Test
Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my Node.js skills through this coding test. I have completed all three tasks and uploaded my solutions to a GitHub repository. Each task has a separate branch in the repository, as per the instructions provided.

## Task 1: Basic Node.js Server
For this task, I created a simple Node.js server using the Express.js framework. The server listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" for all incoming HTTP requests.

The code for this task can be found on the task1 branch of the repository.

## Task 2: Data Manipulation
For this task, I wrote a function in Node.js that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers. I used a basic for loop to iterate over the array and add up the numbers.

The code for this task can be found on the task2 branch of the repository.

## Task 3: Asynchronous File Handling
For this task, I created a Node.js script that reads a text file named "data.txt" and counts the number of words in it. The script uses the built-in fs module to read the file contents and a regular expression to split the text into words.
The code for this task can be found on the task3 branch of the repository.
